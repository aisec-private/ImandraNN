# Examples of Proofs by Induction

## Contents

This folder shows examples of proofs by induction on perceptrons (Section 6).

`top.iml` contains defintions of perceptrons and feed-forward networks. They are then used to prove monotonicity of networks with positive weights by induction. 

The interaction cycle for the proof of monotonicity is given in `monotonicity_proof.log`.

## Usage

#use "top.iml";;

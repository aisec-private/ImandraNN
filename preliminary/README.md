# Feed-Forward Neural Network Implementation

This folder presents the implementation of a multi-layer perceptron trained on the Iris dataset as presented in Section 2.

`mlp.iml` presents a naive version with a hard-coded layer structure. 

`top.iml`, `matrix.iml` and `fully_connected.iml` present a more modular version with matrices as `List`s.
